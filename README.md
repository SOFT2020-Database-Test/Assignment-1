## Reflections  
  
  
### Shooting  
**A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.**  
- She missed the man
- The man was wearing a bulletproof west, and thus did not die form the shot
- The woman used a less-than-lethan gun
- The man is in fact an immortal being, therefor he can not be killed by mere mortals
- Literally millions of possible reasons as to why the man did not die...  
  
  
  
### Alien  
**An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume
that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it
needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as
you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)**  
  
1. With your left hand, grab the tube of toothpaste twist the cap counter-clockwise with your right hand till the cap comes off
2. Grab the toothbrush with your right hand and pick it up so that the bristles are pointing upwards
3. When the cap is completely off, squeeze a generous amount of paste onto the toothbrush's bristles
4. Wet the toothpaste (or dont, however you prefer)
5. Open your mouth and move the toothbrush towards it. Once you reach your mouth, place the bristles onto your teeth and move it around in a circular motion.
6. Do this for all your teeth untill they are sparkly clean.
  
  
  
# Give your thoughts on TDD
**What are positive and good about using TDD?"  
Test Driven Development ensures that all the written code is covered by test so that it can always be tested. this gives the whole team more confidece in the code.  
  
  
**What was annoying or difficult?**  
Nothing, it was quite easy. I have done it before, multiple times.  
  
  
  
**What surprised you**  
Again, nothing.  
  
  
  
**Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?**  
No.
